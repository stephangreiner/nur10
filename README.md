A Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to count reps for several exercises. It is a simple, offline-first tool for personal tracking.

The application's core functionality uses a device's motion sensors to automatically count reps for squats, pull-ups, and back extensions. For push-ups, there is a manual tap-to-count option. All progress data is stored locally on the device, allowing the app to function completely offline. The app tracks daily and monthly totals for each exercise and displays them in a basic statistics view.
